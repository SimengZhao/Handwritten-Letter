- **Image Standardization:**
  - Resized all images to 100x100 pixels for consistency.
  - Simplified model training without compromising data integrity


- **Color Format Retention:**
  - Preserved images in original color format (black ink on white background).
  - Accurately represented visual characteristics, aiding model accuracy.

- **Label Encoding:**
  - Transformed categorical labels into numerical form using `LabelEncoder`.
  - Facilitated numerical processing and preserved class mappings.
```python 
label_encoder = preprocessing.LabelEncoder()
train_label_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_label)
test_label_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(test_label)

y_train = to_categorical(train_label_encoded, 16)
y_test = to_categorical(test_label_encoded, 16)
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Models and Result <a name="Models"></a>

#### 1. Fully Connected Models:
- Fully connected models process flattened input data through multiple layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the next layer, commonly used for image classification. 


#### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized models for processing grid-like data, such as images, preserving spatial structure using convolutional and pooling layers, and commonly used for image classification tasks.

#### Comparision of Model Accuracy
<img width="181" alt="Êà™Â±è2024-02-19 ‰∏ãÂçà11 14 08" src="https://github.com/SimengZhao/Handwritten-Letter/assets/160539675/fc72dd88-dbdd-4110-969a-4d356b0d0d4f">

Our proprietary CNN model demonstrated impressive accuracy, reaching a notable high score of 0.9458, while our dense model achieved a respectable accuracy level of 0.7079. Both models performed admirably, as indicated by these results. However, it was observed that pretrained models, particularly VGG16, outperformed our models in terms of accuracy, achieving exceptionally high scores. This highlights the strength of pretrained networks. Our experience with transfer learning provided valuable insights into the complexities of CNN models. Given the intricate nature of these models, we carefully adjusted the number of epochs to optimize performance without prolonging execution times excessively. This approach enabled us to strike a balance between efficiency and effectiveness in our model training process.

#### Conclusion and Reflection
Our project aimed to explore the fusion of technology and machine learning in education. It's important to recognize the project's limitations: we focused on recognizing specific math symbols, whereas real-world educational scenarios often involve more complex symbols and text. Additionally, our understanding of machine learning was still developing, so our project mainly laid the groundwork for more advanced applications.

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage/Access Information <a name="DataStorage"></a>

Our project utilized Google Colab for its collaborative and cloud-based computing environment. This platform allowed us to seamlessly work together on our project, leveraging its resources for data processing, model development, and analysis.

#### Publication Status:

Throughout the project, we conducted presentations to showcase our progress and findings. As our work is primarily for a course assignment and involves shared collaboration, we haven't yet published our results in a formal academic or research setting. However, our focus has been on rigorously exploring and understanding the problem domain, experimenting with various methodologies, and synthesizing our findings into actionable insights.

Using Colab as our project platform has facilitated efficient collaboration, enabling us to leverage its resources and tools for data analysis, model training, and result visualization. While our results have been presented internally, future plans may involve further refinement of our models and potentially disseminating our findings through publication or presentation in relevant forums.

## Self Reflection of Creating Metadata <a name="SelfReflectionofMetadata"></a>
Accoriding to the [six types of Metadata](https://atlan.com/what-is-metadata/#examples-of-metadata) that Dr. Yasemin Gulbahar shared in class, my project metadata encompasses technical details, governance information with Clarence Zhao credited as the dataset creator, operational aspects detailing data flow from collection to model deployment, and quality metrics for model evaluation. Collaboration is implied through the mention of group members and a professor. Additionally, example usage of code snippets suggests practical applications for the dataset and models. This comprehensive approach provides viewers/users with a clear understanding of the project's scope, context, and potential applications.


**üîπ Which metadata standard did you choose and why?**
I chose the DDI Codebook (DDI-C) standard for my metadata because it fits well with my need for simplicity and individual dataset documentation. As I am very new to GitHub and metadata, DDI-C's straightforward structure, based on XML, would be a user-friendly approach to effectively documenting my dataset.

**üîπ Which template/software did you use?**
I used GitHub to write the README-style metadata because I had never used it before and it seemed like a platform where I could have a lot of fun exploring and creating.

**üîπ What was the most challenging part of creating a ReadME file? How did you overcome these obstacles?**
The most challenging part of creating the README file was getting started, especially since I had never used GitHub before. It took some time to familiarize myself with the platform and its features. Additionally, I encountered difficulties due to the lack of information provided in the original dataset. There was no contact information, license details, DOI, or a comprehensive description of the dataset folders, which made it challenging to provide thorough metadata. To overcome these obstacles, I relied on online resources, some tutorials, and the GitHub guidance.

## *Feedback From Course* <a name="Feedback"></a>
1. If more than one group member, then provide their roles
2. the platform you are using
3. Provide the file versions (and you should have it since we have cleaned it by deleting it from the original files)
4. Provide visuals (your process line, your progress as a picture is preferred)
